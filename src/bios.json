As a Dine about Town coordinator, I, along with my co-coordinator, Fritz Foo, choose the restaurant and talk to the restaurant management in order to arrange the event for Cal Cooking Club members. This year, both Fritz and I are hoping to take club members to restaurants that Cal Students wouldn't normally eat at (either they're out of the way, hole-in-the-wall type places, or nice restaurants that one wouldn't eat at unless one had an occasion to). Our goal is to expose Berkeley students to more dining options and create more social events for members to attend. Personally, I'm hoping to be able to take cooking club members to some fabulous restaurants this semester as well as plan some Snack about Town events as well.",
